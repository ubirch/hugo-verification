verification_info_text = "You have scanned a QR code on a test result and can now have that result verified. This is useful when you need to provide a negative test result, such as in care facilities, hospitals or airplanes.\n\nSince testing is required in many places, the number of faked test results is increasing. Your test result is tamper-proof with UBIRCH's Digital Corona Test Certificate. Such a secured test result creates safety - for you and your surrounding and helps to overcome the pandemic."
